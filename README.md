### ðŸ‘‹ I am Byungki Ryu  
From the **ThermoElectric Science (TES)** group at **KERI**, Changwon, Korea.

Although many papers have reported thermoelectric properties,  the material space remains highly fragmented, making it difficult to develop a unified understanding of **thermoelectric transport**. 

As a **theoretical physicist**, I have been deeply motivated by this challenge. 

Over the past decade, I have worked to develop an  **ultra-high-quality database for thermoelectric materials**. 

This effort led to the creation of:
- ðŸ”Ž **Self-consistent ZT filter**  
- ðŸ§ª **teMatDb**

These tools have also been applied to the world's largest thermoelectric database, **Starrydata2**.

ðŸ“¢ The **method and protocol** behind this high-fidelity database and filtering approach  
will be **published soon**.

### ðŸ”œ Whatâ€™s Next?

I am now developing a data structure for thermoelectric experimental data,  
under the name: **`teMatDb_expt`**
